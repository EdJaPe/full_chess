        <h3>The Game</h3>
        <p>The earliest origins of <b>Chess</b> pinpoints to India at around 7th century. <b>Chatarunga</b> as it was called, is the precursor of chess. The name Chatarunga translates to four division: infantry, cavalry, elephantry and chariotry. These pieces would later evolve to become the pawn, knight, bishop and rook.
        The game name went through many transformations as it was spread to different countries, Persia called it <b>Shatranj</b> Mongols called it <b>Shatar</b>, ultimately in Europe it finally became Chess. </p>
        <p>In earlier accounts of the game. Chess was played with a dice however, the dice was later removed due to gambling restrictions. Some fun facts about the original oldest version. The bishop was only able to move two squares, sideways and front-and-back and could jump over a piece in-between, the queen was able to move only one square diagonally,the pawn could only move one square forward and take over another piece diagonally and be promoted to a Queen.</p>

        <h3>The Pieces</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Pawn </b>.- Can only move two steps at beginning,  can take down another piece diagonally. It can be promoted to another piece besides the king </li>
            <li><b>Rook</b>.- Can only move in straight lines. Cannot jump over pieces.</li>
            <li><b>Knight</b>.- Moves in an “L” shape: two squares in one direction (horizontal or vertical), then one square perpendicular to that. Can jump over pieces. Captures on the square it lands.</li>
            <li><b>Bishop</b>.- Moves any number of squares diagonally. Cannot jump over pieces. Each bishop stays on its starting color (one on light squares, one on dark squares).</li>

        <h3>About me</h3>
        <img src="me.jpg" alt="Ed's picture">
        <p>Hello my name is Edgard, I am a CS undergrad interested in the ways of how the the computer works. I am enjoying the journey to earn the Degree in Computer Science. I find Cybersecurity and Machine Learning very interesting. In fact my minor is in Cybersecurity and have collaborated in research work with Machine Learning.</p>
        <p>My primary goal while being a student at Chico State is to learn the material very well. Enough to teach my very young child a thing or two about the devices we use so much. One of my aspirations is to create my own company developing software that can reach and teach children from developing countries in hard to reach areas. Enough about me enjoy the game I have recreated and tell me how I can improve it.</p>
